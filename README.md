# Password Utilities
This is a small app which has 3 password utilities:
- Generate passwords with several options like length, uppercase characters, numbers, symbols, etc.
- Validate a password against certain criteria.
- Check if a password have been found on a data breach using the [Have I been Pwned?](https://haveibeenpwned.com/Passwords) api.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8
- [Pipenv](https://pypi.org/project/pipenv/) (just for debugging)

## Instructions
